# Blade of Darkness Quick save

Blade of Darkness is a slasher which is mostly written in Python (except 3D engine) and lacks quick save/load mechanism by default for some reason. Extract [repo archive](https://github.com/yeriomin/BladeOfDarknessQuicksave/archive/master.zip) into your game directory to add quick save/load. If you are interested in the changes, original scripts reside in "original" branch.

* Adds bindable quick save and quick load keys, default F5 and F9
* Adds quick save slot in load game menu

Tested with GOG version of Blade of Darkness.
