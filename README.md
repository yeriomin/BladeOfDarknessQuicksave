# Blade of Darkness Quick save

Blade of Darkness is a slasher which is mostly written in Python (except 3D engine) and lacks quick save/load mechanism by default for some reason. Extract repo archive into your game directory to add quick save/load. If you are interested in the changes, original scripts reside in "original" branch.

Tested with GOG version of Blade of Darkness.
